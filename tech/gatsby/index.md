Gatsby is a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator.

*  uses powerful preconfiguration to build a website that uses only static files for incredibly fast page loads, service workers, code splitting, server-side rendering, intelligent image loading, asset optimization, and data prefetching. All out of the box.

*  transforms it into a directory with a single HTML file and your static assets. This folder is uploaded to your favorite hosting provider
